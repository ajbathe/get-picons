# get-picons.sh
v1.0 written by Andreas J. Bathe (2016-10-17)

This script downloads picons from http://picons.xyz and integrates them into Kodi Media Center under /storage/picons

Don't forget to set TV-Settings -> Menu/OSD -> Folder with channel icons to /storage/picons/logos (this path can be different with other OSes).
